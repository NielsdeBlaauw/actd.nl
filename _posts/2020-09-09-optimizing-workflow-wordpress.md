## Introduction
Is your website slow? Does it use a lot of resources to do what others seem to handle effortlessly? Don't know where to start fixing it?

Optimising a website is a creative exercise, but it also requires a process to identify issues. I will outline the steps I use to identify, analyse and fix performance issues.

The examples in this article will be geared towards WordPress and the specific stack I'm used to. The methods used will be applicable in any technology stack.

Remember: *[premature optimisation is the root of all evil](https://stackify.com/premature-optimization-evil/)*. Identification and analysis is an important step. You should not be 'fixing' any code before you are sure it's causing performance issues.

### Why
The performance and efficiency of a website is important. 

An optimized website improves conversion, lowers hosting costs, provides a great user experience and is good for the environment.

The opposite happens on a non-optimised website. Conversion rates go down, you are adding and scaling servers constantly and probably waste CPU time and energy on efficient calculations.
