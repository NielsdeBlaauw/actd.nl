    ‘You cannot make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.’ Things are inevitably going to break. And that’s stressful. If your triaging process involves manually seeking through log files or you only find out something is broken after a customer calls you, then you’re probably not fixing problems efficiently.

    In this lightning talk I will discuss how to prevent, proactively detect and quickly react to issues. He will provide a short overview of tools that help with testing and preventing issues. The talk will cover logging frameworks and platforms that will actively alert you and help find out what’s going wrong. Finally, I will advise on adding metrics to your site in order to prevent future issues.
